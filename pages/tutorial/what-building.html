*Python* is a beautiful programming language. As a designer, I find the clean
code and organization very appealing.

*Django* is a Python framework (like Ruby on Rails is for Ruby, another
programming language you might have heard of). It is the most feature-complete
and beginner-friendly web framework for Python: lots of useful utilities are
built in and there is a massive amount of resources (tutorials as well as
plugins) due to the size of the Django community.

But what exactly are we building?

Most tutorials start with a specific project. The official Django tutorial, for
example, creates a polling app. But what if that tutorial subject doesn't
interest you?

If you're like me, you would finish the tutorial but not feel any "ownership"
over what you built because you essentially replicated another project. It's
hard to relate and really understand what you're doing unless you feel involved.
To that end, we're going to try something a little different here.

Hello Web App is going to walk you through building a generic "collection of
things." However, this framework covers many different types of web apps you
could build:

* A blog, which is a collection of posts.
* An online store, which is a collection of items you could buy.
* An online directory, which is a collection of people's profiles.
* ... and so on and so forth.

What's written here is going to be generic and vanilla, and it's up to you to
decide what exactly you're going to build using Hello Web App. Pretty much the
only thing you're going to change are the names of code bits, but the
functionality will remain the same.

Some specific examples of what you could build using this book:

* A ratings website for a collection of things. Really love backpacking? You
    could create a website that shows your reviews for various pieces of
    equipment.
* A directory of people. This was my original project — I built a listing of
    custom wedding invitation designers. You could also do a listing of
    conference attendees, a list of awesome web people, such and so forth.
* An online store. There are a lot of solutions out there that help you set up a
    store without coding it, but it might be fun to build a store from the
    ground up to sell products.
* Or a blog, as mentioned above.

Take five minutes and think about a collection of objects that you're going to
build using Hello Web App. Don't worry about scope just yet (we're getting to
that); just find something you would be interested in working on.

**What's your "collection of things" project?**

## MVP: Minimum Viable Product

Oh goodness, there's an acronym sneaking in, and I said I wouldn't do that.

Your MVP—Minimum Viable Product, a popular term in start-up land—is the minimum
you need to build for your app to work and be useful to users. 

Sometimes people get an idea for something they want to build and spend four
years trying to perfect it. But there will always be another feature to add,
another bug to fix, another thing to improve, all while you could be getting
real people to use your app and give you feedback (**real** feedback) on how to
improve.

Building your idea might seem really intimidating, especially when working with
real customers. But having real customers will be an incredible motivation to
work on your web app more.

For example, my first programming project mentioned before — today, it's chock
full of features. There are free and paid accounts, using Stripe and PayPal to
trigger recurring charges. There are a bunch of different ways to browse pages,
such as by location, by budget, or by style. There's an API so other websites
can integrate vendor listings into their websites powered by my app.

**None of these features existed in the first version I built.** 

The only real features I needed for that first version were:

* A homepage.
* A profile page for each stationer in the directory.
* A basic search by location page. 
* A form so a stationer could apply to join the directory.
* And static pages: About, Contact, etc.

It took me only six weeks from deciding to learn how to program to launch my
first app. Two weeks later, it was profiled in a prominent design blog. Swamped
by customers, my startup was born. 

**Even the simplest of web apps can grow into something big.** Something you
build now could become a business.

Take some time to write down your "collection of things" project idea, and then
write down every awesome feature you think it should have. Then, circle only the
ones that are really truly necessary. Make your web app as small and easy to
launch as possible. With luck, the lessons of Hello Web App will be all you need
to launch your app, and if not, you'll have only a few new concepts to learn
before you can launch.
