There are a few things and principles you should know about building web apps.
Generally you can do whatever you want (have fun programming!) but keep these
points in mind:

## Code style 

Python has a style guide known as PEP 8 which gives coding conventions and gives
recommendations — such as, the numbers of space per indent (four), comment
styling (above the code, starting with # and a single space), and other tidbits. 

Why is this important? These conventions will keep your code consistent and
readable, to yourself in the future as well as for any others who will read your
code. 

The style guide includes recommendations like this:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
Yes: spam(ham[1], {eggs: 2})
No:  spam( ham[ 1 ], { eggs: 2 } )
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
Read more about PEP 8 and the Python style guide here:
[http://hellobks.com/44](http://hellobks.com/44)

## Documentation

Another recommendation for your future self as well as other reviewers of your
code — good documentation.

This might seem superfluous while you're programing — of course you know what's
going on as you're typing it — but you could come back later and think, "What
the heck was I doing?"

It's always a good idea to add comments above your code to describe what's going
on. For example, random chuck of code from my app:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python codespace">
for line in fileinput.input(paths):
    if not line.strip():
        # Empty line
        continue

    # Split the log into its' individual parts
    access = parse_access_log(line)
    if not access:
        continue

    user_agent = access['user_agent']
    if "bot" in user_agent:
        # ignore everything with "bot" in the name
        continue

    # Check if we're in the desired parsing range. If not, skip or exit.
    if time_since and timestamp &lt; time_since:
        # Fast forward
        continue
    else:
        # None specified, assume from the first entry.
        time_since, time_until = timestamp_to_range(timestamp)

    if time_until and timestamp &gt;= time_until:
        # Done
        return time_until
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
You *could* write the above without the comments, but it's a lot easier to read
and skim with them added. It's always a good idea to document what you're doing
as you go.

## Security

I remember when I was building my first web app and I showed it to a friend
before launch. He immediately went to the page where users could update their
logic and figured out that the number in my edit page URL
(*http://mywebapp.com/edit/1*) corresponded to the ID of the object, so he could
change it to something like */21/* and see another person's object, and then
edit it because I wasn't checking for ownership when displaying the page. Duh,
right? It stands out to me as the first time I realized that people were going
to try to actively break my app, and that I needed to always keep in mind
security precautions.

Back in "Adding a Registration Page," we added the `@login_required` decorator
as well as checking ownership on the object when updating the edit page to make
sure you don't make the same mistake I did.

Another issue I had with my app back in the day was a silly favoriting ability I
added: users could save their favorites as they browsed the site. I didn't
require the users to have an account — I saved the favorite with their
`session_id` in the database. However, months later I discovered that there
seemed to be a bot going through all of my listings and favoriting everything,
causing hundreds of database saves and drastically slowing down (and sometimes
taking down) my site. Seriously? Someone did that to me?

That problem has since been fixed, but again, my tiny little site got targeted
by people looking to break it. Keep an eye out for vulnerabilities that your app
could have and try to prevent things like this. For more about potential
security issues you could run into, check out this article:

## Using the Django Shell

When I first started learning how to program, I felt more comfortable building
my views and seeing the results in the template — and I suspect a lot of other
beginners are the same, thus the format of this book. Most experienced
programmers don't do this, however, preferring to test code in the command line
window. It's faster, once you get used to it.

Like how we ran `python manage.py runserver` in the command line (feel free to
open a new window if you'd like), run `python manage.py shell`:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="sh">
<span class="cmd">$</span> python manage.py shell
Python 2.7.8 (default, Aug 24 2014, 21:26:19) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 5.1 (clang-503.0.40)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
(InteractiveConsole)
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
Here, you can import settings and run commands just like in your *views.py*, but
see instantaneous results. 
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from collection.models import Thing
&gt;&gt;&gt; things = Thing.objects.all()
&gt;&gt;&gt; for thing in things:
...     print thing
... 
Hello Thing
Another Thing
Yet Another!
Another Name of a Thing
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
The first three lines were commands I typed in — first importing `Thing` from
our models, then running a query to grab all of our `Thing`s, then running a
for-loop to print all of the `Thing` names. When the shell detects a code block
(like our for loop), it'll give you another row to type the next line in (make
sure to add the indent.) An extra return will indicate that you're done with the
command. This is hard to explain in print — try it out and play around and it
should become more clear.

When you create more complex views, you can walk through the code in your shell
to confirm that it's working correctly before seeing the results in the
template. You can also use it to grab and update information in your database
without using the admin panel (but make sure to be careful so you don't erase or
overwrite information that you need.)

In a nut shell, the shell is a handy skill to have once you're comfortable using
it.
