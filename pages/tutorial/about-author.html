# About the Author

Tracy Osborn is a designer, developer, and entrepreneur living in the Bay Area of California. Building websites since she was twelve, she always felt an affinity to computers, the internet, and what it brings us. 

Tracy graduated with a BFA in Art &amp; Design with a concentration in Graphic Design from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, and worked as a web designer for five years before teaching herself programming and launching her first startup, WeddingLovely. 

She's also an avid outdoorswoman, hiking over 200 miles on the John Muir Trail solo in 2014.
