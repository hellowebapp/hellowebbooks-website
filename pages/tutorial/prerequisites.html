This tutorial works best for those who have a solid understanding of HTML and
CSS.

If you haven't worked with HTML before, there are tons of resources to help get
you started with front-end development. Here are a few recommended resources:

* HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites
    ([http://hellobks.com/1](http://hellobks.com/1))
* Learn to Code HTML &amp; CSS
    ([http://hellobks.com/2](http://hellobks.com/2))
* Don't Fear the Internet: Basic HTML &amp; CSS for Non-Web Designers
    ([http://hellobks.com/3](http://hellobks.com/3))

It is recommended and highly encouraged to be comfortable building a website
using basic HTML and CSS before jumping into this book. If you're not, it won't
take long to get there.

## Python (just a bit)

Here's the big one!

"But this is a book on how to learn how to program. Why do I need Python
knowledge?" you might be asking.

The best resources for learning the basic principles in Python have already been
written and are online for free: no need for Hello Web App to reinvent the
wheel.

My personal favorite: *Learn Python The Hard Way*
([http://hellobks.com/4](http://hellobks.com/4)) by Zed Shaw, which
contains a series of easy and well written Python exercises. Try to get through
at least half. It shouldn't take very long.

Alternatively (or in addition), the video tutorial *Hands-On Intro to Python for
Beginning Programmers* ([http://hellobks.com/5](http://hellobks.com/5)) by
Jessica McKeller is excellent.

Make sure you at least partially understand the following concepts (More info:
[http://hellobks.com/6](http://hellobks.com/6)):

* Variables
* If-statements
* For-loops
* Comments

If you don't feel like an expert, or even an intermediate, that's okay — these
concepts will make more and more sense to you as you play around with
programming. Once you feel like you have a basic grasp, we can start building
our web app.

## Suggestion: A Linux or Mac computer

Unfortunately, the Windows environment doesn't play as nicely with development
and programming as Unix-based systems do (such as Linux and Mac operating
systems.)

This doesn't mean you can't develop on Windows, and all Hello Web App
instructions are written with both in mind. However, in general, life will be a
lot easier on a Unix-based system, so if you have the option to use something
other than a Windows environment, it's highly encouraged that you do so.

If you're using Windows and have any issues with Hello Web App's instructions
while going through this book, check out our Windows resource page here:
