We're going to go over some small things in this chapter that aren't worthy of
pulling out into a chapter of their own. Simple things that are pretty
important.

## Setting up 404 and 500 error pages

When you're going through this tutorial, because you're working locally and your
`DEBUG` setting in *settings.py* is set to True, Django gives you a nice error
page with all the info about your error. However, it's not good to show that
info to random users of your web app.

Head to *settings.py* and change `DEBUG` to `False`. Additionally, Django will
whine unless we update the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting. Right now, let's set it to
everything (A.K.A., we'll allow any host), but add a note that we should update
it to our future domain on our launched app for security's sake.

*settings.py*
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
DEBUG = False 
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

*settings.py*
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
# XXX: Update me before launch!
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

Check out what happens when you go to a non-existent page and get a 404
response:
{% endfilter %}

<figure class="caption">
    <img src="/static/images/tutorial/404.png" alt=""/>
</figure>

{% filter markdown %}
Ew, a default browser page not using our app's styles. Let's add a 404 page,
shall we?

### Add your template files

Create *404.html* and *500.html* files in your templates directory:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="sh">
<span class="cmd">$</span> cd collection/templates/
<span class="cmd">collection/templates $</span> touch 404.html
<span class="cmd">collection/templates $</span> touch 500.html
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

Then update the template contents:

*404.html*
{% endfilter %}

{% verbatim %}
<pre><code class="django">
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block title %}
    404 - {{ block.super }}
{% endblock title %}

{% block content %}
    &lt;h1&gt;404 Error&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've run into a page that doesn't exist!&lt;/p&gt;
{% endblock content %}
</code></pre>
{% endverbatim %}

{% filter markdown %}

*500.html*
{% endfilter %}

{% verbatim %}
<pre><code class="django">
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block title %}
    500 - {{ block.super }}
{% endblock title %}

{% block content %}
    &lt;h1&gt;500 Error&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You've run into an error!&lt;/p&gt;
{% endblock content %}
</code></pre>
{% endverbatim %}

{% filter markdown %}

That's all you need to do! Take a look at the broken page again in your browser:
{% endfilter %}

<figure class="caption">
    <img src="/static/images/tutorial/404-2.png" alt=""/>
</figure>

{% filter markdown %}
Custom error pages, woohoo! Make sure to change `DEBUG` in *settings.py* back to
`True` before you move on.

## Setting up a requirements.txt

This part of the chapter won't make any website changes or be visible to your
future users, but will make setting up your app on other computers and working
with others much easier.

A `requirements.txt` file lists everything installed in your project, in your
virtual environment. If you ever had a clean virtual environment in the future
and needed to install everything to make your web app work, you could run `pip
install -r requirements.txt` and pip will go through the entire list and install
everything at once. It's a convention for Python, and super useful.

First, let's get a list of everything installed so far. Run `pip freeze` in your
command line (make sure you're in your virtual environment first):

{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
<span class="cmd">$</span> pip freeze
Django==1.9.1
django-registration-redux==1.3
wsgiref==0.1.2
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
We installed the first two, and the last (`wsgiref`) is something installed by
virtualenv. To set up your *requirements.txt*, make sure you're in the top level
directory (the same one as *manage.py*) and pipe the contents of `pip freeze`
into the new file:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
<span class="cmd">$</span> pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
Check out your new *requirements.txt* file, which should look like the below:

*requirements.txt*
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
Django==1.9.1
django-registration-redux==1.3
wsgiref==0.1.2
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
That's all you need to do. You can test it out by running `pip install -r
requirements.txt`, and pip will let you know everything is installed already:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="sh">
<span class="cmd">$</span> pip install -r requirements.txt 
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): Django==1.9.1 in ./venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): django-registration-redux==1.3 in ./venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from -r requirements.txt (line 2))
Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): wsgiref==0.1.2 in /usr/local/Cellar/python/2.7.8_1/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7 (from -r requirements.txt (line 3))
Cleaning up...
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

Awesome. Future you or friends can install your app more easily now by
installing from your requirements file!

## Setting up your first tests

When you have your app deployed live to the world, nothing is worse than making
a "quick change," deploying, and then discovering you broke a major feature or
(worse) took down the entire site. This is especially common when your app does
a lot of different things that tie together in ways that you might forget â€”
change one thing and something else breaks. You could manually go through the
website yourself, making sure everything works by clicking from page to page and
testing features, but that's time consuming.

That's why we write tests, so we can run a command and test our functionality in
the command line, making sure the site is up and everything works without having
to test manually.
 
Let's set up a basic test to make sure our site is working without errors.
Django created a file already for your tests in your `collection` app. Update it
to the below:

*tests.py*
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
from django.test import TestCase

<b>class CollectionTest(TestCase):
    def test_index(self):
        r = self.client.get('/')
        self.assertEqual(r.status_code, 200)

    def test_no_logic_page(self):
        r = self.client.get('/about/')
        self.assertEqual(r.status_code, 200) </b>
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
We're creating tests for our `collection` app, first testing whether our
homepage pops up, as well as testing whether a simple no-logic page (our "about"
page) works as well. For each, we're "grabbing" the page and assigning it to the
variable `r`, and then asserting whether the page's status code equals 200
(which, as you know, means OK. More info:
[http://hellobks.com/30](http://hellobks.com/30))

To run the test, head back to your command line and run `python manage.py test`,
and you should see the below output:
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="sh">
<span class="cmd">$</span> python manage.py test
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
..
-------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.033s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}
Boom, ran 2 tests, and everything was OK.

What if something went wrong? Go into your *views.py* and add a typo to your
index view:

*views.html*
{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="python">
def index(request):
    things = Thing.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'index.html', {
        # typo below!
        <b>'things': thinggs,</b>
    })
</code></pre>

{% filter markdown %}

And then run your tests again:

{% endfilter %}

<pre><code class="sh">
<span class="cmd">$</span> python manage.py test
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
E.

Nifty, right? Make sure to fix the typo and commit your work. Read more about
Django tests here: [http://hellobks.com/31](http://hellobks.com/31)

Get into the practice of running your tests often, and especially before
deploying your web app live. Might save your bacon!
