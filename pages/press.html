            <p><strong>LEARN HOW TO BUILD YOUR OWN STARTUP WITH NEW SELF-PUBLISHED PROGRAMMING BOOK BY TRACY OSBORN</strong></p>

            <p>May 4, 2015 — Entrepreneur and designer Tracy Osborn has released her first book, Hello Web App, aimed at teaching designers and non-programmers how to code their own web apps.</p>

            <p>"This is the first step in building a new startup or lifestyle business," says Tracy. "With the recent learn-to-code revolution — <a href="http://recode.net/2015/02/14/obama-everybodys-got-to-learn-how-to-code/">promoted by President Obama himself</a> — this is the next step for anyone looking for build their own website."</p>

            <p>Jacob Kaplan-Moss, a core contributor to the Django programming language says, "This is one of the best tutorials I've seen. It's really hands-on, it's very actionable, it's extremely well written, and it looks gorgeous. This book is my go-to pick for when people ask what's the best way to learn Django."</p>

            <p>The book can be purchased from <a href="http://hellowebapp.com/">HelloWebApp.com</a> as well as on <a href="http://amzn.to/1yLsHFH">Amazon</a>.</p>
