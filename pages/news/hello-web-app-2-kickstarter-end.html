Thank you _so much_ to everyone who backed the campaign, shared it with friends and family, and supported the re-release of my first book.

The files have been at the printer for awhile already, so I should be getting the paperbacks soon to send out to everyone. I'm also finishing up the videos and will be releasing the digital packages super soon.

Thank you again! Super excited to get this out. ðŸŽ‰
