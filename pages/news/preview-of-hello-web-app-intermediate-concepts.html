title: Preview of Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts
# headline: 
excerpt: I started working on the design of Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts yesterday! I recorded a quick screencast so you can check out the new book. I've only had one days worth of design time on it so far (so it's kind of rough) but since I'm using the design files from the last book, it's already about 80% done.

I started working on the design of Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts yesterday! I recorded a quick screencast so you can check out the new book. I've only had one days worth of design time on it so far (so it's kind of rough) but since I'm using the design files from the last book, it's already about 80% done.

Only about 1.5 days left in the Kickstarter campaign ([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1868398473/hello-web-app-intermediate-concepts](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1868398473/hello-web-app-intermediate-concepts)). Reminder, all Kickstarter campaign orderers will get their book by early December, so pre-order if you want the new book. Of course any donations to support are super duper appreciated too!
