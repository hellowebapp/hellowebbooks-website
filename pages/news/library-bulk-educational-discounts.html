I've gotten a few questions lately about bulk, library, and educational discounts for all Hello Web Books, so I thought I'd write a quick note here.

Of course, I'm happy to give a discount for the above use-cases â€” just write me at [tracy@hellowebbooks.com](mailto:tracy@hellowebbooks.com) and I'll set up a special order form with a discount. While my [order page](/order) sells the paperback book with the digital files included, I'm also happy to send just paperbacks (at a reduced price) for bulk/educational orders as well.
